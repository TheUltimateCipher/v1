    <p>
      Q: How do I get the VIP code? <br />
      A: The VIP code can obtained by correcly answering a riddle. Didn't
      see that coming? Well now you did. The answer to the riddle is the VIP 
      code. Here are some tips to help you out: If you're sure you
      got it right make sure the code you enter is completely capatilized. Also,
      the VIP code doesn't have any special characters like ! ? , . etc. 
      If you are ready this is the riddle: "I am the beginning of the end, 
      and the start of eternity. In a corner where shadows play, I hide 
      beneath the light of day. Give me a high five and reveal the secrets 
      of the unkown."

      Q: Is my message safe? (How does the cipher work?) <br />
      A: I have made a detailed video describing the workings of
      The Ultimate Cipher in this video:
      <a
        href="#"
        onclick="window.location.href='https://youtu.be/8YmlmhTrQT0?si=44TvEvmja0SFBfnJ';"
        > video link</a
      >.
      Alternatively if your brain is bigger than your fist you could 
      try to comrehend the source code on GitHub:
      <a
        href="#"
        onclick="window.location.href='https://github.com/TheUltimateCipher/theultimatecipher.github.io';"
        >GitHub link</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Q: Where can I find more info? <br />
      A: I created wiki for the Ultimate Cipher with a lot more 
      information which can be found via this link:
      <a
        href="#"
        onclick="window.location.href='https://youtu.be/8YmlmhTrQT0?si=44TvEvmja0SFBfnJ';"
        > link</a
      >.
