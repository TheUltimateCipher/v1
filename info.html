    <h1>FAQ Continued</h1>
    <p>
      Q: How do I get the VIP code? <br />
      A: Ah yes. You want the VIP code? Well unfortunately you gotta solve this
      riddle first. The answer to the riddle is the VIP code. If you're sure you
      got it right make sure the code you enter is completely capatilized. Also,
      the VIP code doesn't have any special characters like ! ? , . etc. Enough
      jabbering, heres the riddle: "I am the beginning of the end, and the start
      of eternity. In a corner where shadows play, I hide beneath the light of
      day. Give me a high five and reveal the secrets of the unkown."

      Q: Is my message safe? (How does the cipher work?) <br />
      A: Welp as the creator of this cipher I would say yes. But of course that
      would be biased so let me tell you the features of my cipher and you can
      choose for yourself. When you click the submit button for the encryption
      process the program randomly generates a secret key that is always
      different (this is why even if you put in the same message you get a
      different decrypted message). It then uses this key to encyrpt the rest of
      the message with a cipher (its not a shift cipher by the way its 10 times
      stronger). Then it combines the key with the encrypted message and outputs
      it to the user. Unfortunately, if I give too much detail on how it truly
      works you could just crack it sooooo... umm... I'd like to keep my secrets
      a secret. BUT If you're really determined to find out how I truly created
      my program I suppose you could check the source code on

    <h1>Credits</h1>
    <p>
      The cipher was the idea of BernieCodez and made possible with ChatGPT. Umm
      I kinda cheated a little okay but I did code a 'large' portion of it.
