      <p>
        Q: What is the VIP code and what does it do? <br />
        A: Its a special code for VIPs. It gives you access to particles,
        special themes, the VIP only page, removes encryption and decryption
        loading tiems, and removes the 10 character encryption limit. Overall
        the VIP code gives the user a ton of access to things they are not
        normally able to access.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What characters are supported? <br />
        A: The following characters are supported: all ENGLISH letters 
        upper and lowercase, spaces, !, ?, ', ,, ., /, ), (, %, $, *, ", :. 
        ANY CHARACTERS THAT ARE NOT ONE OF THESE ARE NOT SUPPORTED! 
        For example, emojis and other symbols can not be encrypted. You can 
        tell if a message is not encrypted properly if there is a space 
        somewhere in the message. A normal message WILL NOT have spaces
        in the final encrypted message so if yours does its not encrypted 
        properly.
