If you are a curious person looking at the source code of my project this file
has NOTHING useful in it. Its just where I note bugs and other stuff.
IDK why you would want to read it but if so help yourself:

Ur favicon still needs to be applied to all webpages mronrn
Make the wording in some places better cuz its supposd 
to be more proffesional for the judges.

SMALL ISSUE LAST PRIORITY: Theme loading is good WITHOUT custom background image. Fix small flash
between website navigation.

The particles for the seasons are not properly loading partially cuz ur an idiot and 
mostly because YOUR FORGOT TO CREATE THE PARTICLES IN THE FIRST PLACE>
Also the seasonal themes still look horrifying so please fix css
